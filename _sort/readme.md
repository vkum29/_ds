# Sorting
A way to rearrange raw information (data) in orderly format.

## Stable or Unstable
A sort is said to be stable if after sorting sequences of similar content is same as in original data else its unstable.

## In-place or Not-in-place
An in-place sorting doesn't need a additional memory to temporarily store partial data.

## Adaptive and Non-Adaptive
If the algorithm takes into account already sorted items and doesn't do unnecessary operation on these items, it is adaptive.
